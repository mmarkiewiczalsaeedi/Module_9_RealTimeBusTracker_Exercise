# Bus Stops Map Animation

## Description
A JavaScript application that utilizes MapboxGL to display a map with a moving marker representing a bus moving between MIT and Harvard. The marker updates its position based on predefined bus stops.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Ensure you have a valid Mapbox access token. Replace the placeholder token in the code.
4. Observe the marker moving between bus stops on the map.

## Code Overview
- **JavaScript (script.js)**: Contains the logic to initialize the Mapbox map, add a marker, and move the marker between predefined bus stops.
- **HTML (index.html)**: Creates a webpage with a container for the map.
- **CSS (styles.css)**: Defines minimal styling for the map container.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of a bus moving between MIT and Harvard.
- Utilizes MapboxGL for interactive map rendering.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In future updates, we plan to:
- Enhance the user interface with additional information.
- Add functionality for user interaction, such as stopping or restarting the animation.
- Explore options for customizing the map's appearance.
